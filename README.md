# Reddit-Scraper
## By Julian Marks

Utilizing a python library called [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or Python Reddit API Wrapper, I created an application which allows you to quickly load images from a desired SubReddit based on the number of upvotes, allowing you to receive the most popular content of the community.
